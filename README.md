# adventofcode-2024

Some passing thoughts written on the morning of Christmas day.
Motivation was low again this year. The puzzles didn't leave much of an impression besides a handful of them. Can't belive I've done ten of these starting back in 2017.

- **Day 1** - who cares
- **Day 2** - spent some time working out how to dampen without brute forcing but it was too messy so i deleted it. look for diffs out of range and make sure to remove the middle element if there are two in a row.
- **Day 3** - forgettable
- **Day 4** - uh messy grid searching
- **Day 5** - so eric gives us a sorting function and you call the stdlib
- **Day 6** - first interesting problem of the year. I brute forced like everyone else. not worth the bother of building/modifying a subraph. tried to do something smarter at first but foiled by 'edge' cases.
- **Day 7** - do i work forward or backwards? why not both! (forward do work out bounds for pruning branches.)
- **Day 8** - forgettable, follow the instructions 'puzzle'. i added the vector util here. not really needed but whatever.
- **Day 9** - a reminder that sometimes just following the instructions is messy and involved. i liked the allocator themse for a puzzle.
- **Day 10** - forgettable. i did the obvious way for part 2 before reading the puzzle enough to solve part 1.
- **Day 11** - pretty obvious dp puzzle.
- **Day 12** - the second interesting puzzle. i joined together the edges to solve at first but then read that you can count corners instead which makes total sense.
- **Day 13** - really... eric can't make math problems easier than this.
- **Day 14** - neat part 2. an actual puzzle. i found the tree based on neighbour counts at first, but read that you can use the metric from p1 as a rudimentary measure of entropy.
- **Day 15** - okay this one was a cool idea even if not actually that difficult.
- **Day 16** - djikstra is an aoc staple... was stuck on p2 for too long because i was counting both directions to the end instead of just the highest scoring.
- **Day 17** - third interesting problem. vms are always fun but a bit stale by now. Very cool p2.
- **Day 18** - eh, changed part 2 to bsearch after checking answers. at first just brute forced without thinking too deeply about it.
- **Day 19** - very easy combinatorial problem for this late in the year. i liked the towel design theme at least.
- **Day 20** - reindeer race. interesting problem. took me a few attempts to look at the problem in the right way and find a good approach.
- **Day 21** - okay. puzzle of the year. i looked up a hint for p2 or would have spent hours before realising i should work from the last robot outwards instead of the opposite direction.
- **Day 22** - the hardest part of this was figuring out wtf eric was asking for in p2. goddamn monkeys.
- **Day 23** - idk if i'm a fan of these look up the graph algo puzzles.
- **Day 24** - great penultimate puzzle. i've been trained by previous years to use graphviz to visualize when the input is like this. did this semi manually and don't care enough to try to automate it. it's easy to find a mismatch but how do you find the fix without brute forcing? Or is the swap always within the same adder? (Does it have to be to avoid a cycle in p1?)
- **Day 25** - merry xmas

Good puzzles:
- Day 6 - patrol
- Day 12 - counting corners in the garden
- Day 14 - find the christmas tree
- Day 15 - pushing crates
- Day 17 - intcode
- Day 20 - reindeer race
- Day 21 - keypads
- Day 24 - full adder

So all in all not a bad year in terms of variety but the difficulty was definitely low compared to past years outside of a few puzzles. Oh well. At least this didn't take much thought or time on most days.
